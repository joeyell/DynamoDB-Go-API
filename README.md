# GoLang REST API with AWS Lambda and DynamoDB

This project is all about me diving into AWS Lambda and DynamoDB, learning as I go, and developing a GoLang REST API in the process. I experimented with the AWS SDK and Golang's Gin web framework to set up routes that allow users to POST and GET data from a DynamoDB table.

## Features
- Developed a GoLang REST API leveraging AWS Lambda and DynamoDB.
- Utilised the AWS SDK and GoLang's Gin web framework to manage various routes.
- Implemented functionality to allow users to both POST and GET data from a DynamoDB table.
